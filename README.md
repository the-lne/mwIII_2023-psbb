Call of Duty Modern Warfare III 2023 - Player Skill Based Balancing

  Modern Warfare III (Sledgehammer Games, 2023) is the worst-reviewed Call of Duty game in recent memory. Unfortunately, technologies such as Skill Based Matchmaking (SBMM, also referred to as Engagement Optimized Matchmaking or EOMM), and Skill Based Hit Detection (SBHD) result in a grossly curated experience akin to that of a slot machine where the enthused wins just enough to keep themselves playing. It is assumed that in a similar fashion to casinos, certain social media platforms, and services, proprietary statistics regarding user engagement are recorded, analyzed, and eventually implemented via features to increase playtime, player retention, etc. While this is in itself not considered to be a bad thing, anecdotal reports, largely and at times, solely blame Sledgehammer Games' method of addressing such issues (SBMM, SBHD, among others) for the inconsistent and therefore poor online experience.

  Professional Call of Duty players, the community, and reviewers alike have unanimously deemed this game unplayable due to reports of Sledgehammer Games' suite of Engagement Optimization technologies, most notably doing the following with respect to user profile statistics, dynamically sizing hitboxes, prioritizing algorithmic analysis results of player stats over geography in online matchmaking, and blatant rigging of games (e.g. connecting players on a winning streak with matches that are bound to lose).

  If the "algorithm" as many call it, truly works against statistically above-average players, then the opposite must be true. This program actively lowers a given player's statistics in an attempt to, at the very least, anecdotally prove or disprove this notion.
